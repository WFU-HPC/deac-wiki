## Introduction

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has 
a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources 
that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily 
build and deploy ML powered applications.

See: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34429
```
vim third_party/nccl/build_defs.bzl.tpl
```


Run ./configure and select the appropriate options for building with CUDA, and using /usr/bin/gcc

```
./configure 
WARNING: --batch mode is deprecated. Please instead explicitly shut down your Bazel server using the command "bazel shutdown".

    /usr/include


Please specify a list of comma-separated CUDA compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size, and that TensorFlow only supports compute capabilities >= 3.5 [Default is: 7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0]: 6.0,7.0

Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]: N
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /bin/gcc]: /usr/bin/gcc

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: N
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native -Wno-sign-compare]: 

Would you like to interactively configure ./WORKSPACE for Android builds? [y/N]: N
Not configuring the WORKSPACE for Android builds.

Preconfigured Bazel build configs. You can use any of the below by adding "--config=<>" to your build command. See .bazelrc for more details.
	--config=mkl         	# Build with MKL support.
	--config=monolithic  	# Config for mostly static monolithic build.
	--config=gdr         	# Build with GDR support.
	--config=verbs       	# Build with libverbs support.
	--config=ngraph      	# Build with Intel nGraph support.
	--config=numa        	# Build with NUMA support.
	--config=dynamic_kernels	# (Experimental) Build kernels into separate shared objects.
Preconfigured Bazel build configs to DISABLE default on features:
	--config=noaws       	# Disable AWS S3 filesystem support.
	--config=nogcp       	# Disable GCP support.
	--config=nohdfs      	# Disable HDFS support.
	--config=noignite    	# Disable Apache Ignite support.
	--config=nokafka     	# Disable Apache Kafka support.
	--config=nonccl      	# Disable NVIDIA NCCL support.
Configuration finished
```

Run bazel to build the Python package for tensorflow
```
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures
mkdir tmp
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package tmp/tensorflow_pkg
```

Install the tensorflow package via pip
```
pip install tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
```
Verify the installation
```
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.contrib.eager.num_gpus())"
```
