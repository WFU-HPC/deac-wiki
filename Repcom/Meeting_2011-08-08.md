# Discussion

> ## Annual Cluster Purchase
>
>   - Given projected work for fall, deferring annual purchase to the
>     spring.
>   - Some grant money needs to be spent now (in next couple weeks).
>
> :\* Natalie Holzwarth
>
> :\* Jacque Fetrow
>
> :\* Joel Stitzel (WFU BME)
>
> :\* Others?
>
>   - What to purchase?
>
> :\* Stitzel group will be looking for more Infiniband resources
>
> :\* Do we need 96GB nodes?
>
> :\* If no specialized needs, will continue hardware refresh plan
> (replace another 14 nodes of 16GB nodes with 48GB nodes)
>
> ## CY2011 Shutdown
>
>   - Change from April meeting: Date changed to Sep 6-9 (from 8/29-9/2)
>
> <!-- end list -->
>
>   - Lots of hardware firmware updates
>
> :\* Storage Device Code Upgrades
>
> :\* Network Switch Code Upgrades
>
> :\* GPFS Filesystem Software Upgrades (at risk, due to compressed
> timeline)
>
> ## 10 Gbps Network Upgrade
>
>   - 100% chance it will happen
>   - Timeline contingent:
>
> :\* University's 10Gbps Internet link upgrades
>
> :\* Fiber optic cable route validation
>
>   - Ideal to happen during downtime. This is still the goal.
>   - It is possible to handle the upgrade "live" but connectivity from
>     the cluster to campus/internet will have some minor interruptions.
>
> ## RHEL 6 Upgrade
>
>   - We have made almost zero progress toward a RHEL6 development
>     environment.
>   - RHEL4 Support Ends January 2012\!
>   - User community will have very limited testing time on RHEL6
>     environment before having to make cutover.
>
> <!-- end list -->
>
>   - Software licensing, support, and costs we need to be worried about
>     (question for users)?
>
> :\* Gaussian - desired version?
>
> :\* CHARMM - update from Fred: licensed to a particular research
> group, not by site. Probably not a good candidate for central funding.
>
> :\* LS-DYNA (costs covered by WFUBMC)
>
> :\* Matlab - Any expected growth in cluster usage? We have licensed
> DCS now. Need to install.
>
> ::\* Tim might submit a capital request for this.
>
> :\* Mathematica - now at 30 licenses (still need to load license)
