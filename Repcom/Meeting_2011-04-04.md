# Discussion

> ## CY2011 Shutdown
>
>   - Definitely need one
>
> :\* 10Gbps Network Changes (required downtime)
>
> :\* Storage Device Code Upgrades (required downtime)
>
> :\* Network Switch Code Upgrades (required downtime for one switch,
> optional for two others)
>
> :\* GPFS Filesystem Software Upgrades (downtime makes it convenient)
>
>   - Proposed date : Aug 29 - Sep 2
>
> ## 10 Gbps Network Upgrade
>
>   - Reviewed what we are planning on doing.
>   - Awaiting NC-REN detailed quote.
>   - Required WFU hardware purchased and received.
>   - 95% chance this will happen.
>   - There are connectivity and service availability implications.
>
> ## RHEL 6 Upgrade
>
>   - We are starting the infrastructure work to support RHEL6 cluster
>     node imaging.
>   - Goal is to have a development environment by June 1 (very
>     optimistic)
>   - RHEL4 Support Ends January 2012\!
>   - Core WFU DEAC Software for RHEL6

> :\* What should not?
>
> :\* What does "supported" mean?
