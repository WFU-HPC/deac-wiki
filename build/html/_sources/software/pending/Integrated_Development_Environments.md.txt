**Integrated Development Environments** (IDEs) are software which
integrate all the tools a programmer uses in developing code: editor,
debugger, profiler/instrumenter, compiler (if necessary), and
documentation access.

IDEs are very useful for the programmer, and are a great boost to
productivity.

  - They automate a lot of the repetitive chores for you, such as
    maintaining a logical directory structure, and generating makefiles.
  - It is not necessary to switch windows between debugger, editor, and
    running program.
  - Documentation may be accessed directly within the editor, e.g. you
    may get a contextual menu on any library function, and read its
    documentation within the IDE itself.
  - IDEs maintain a symbol reference of your code so that you may point
    at a function or variable in the editor, and pop up a contextual
    menu to go to the place where it is defined, even if it is in a
    separate file. This also allows the IDE to show you exactly where a
    particular symbol has been used anywhere within a project.
  - Current IDEs have [code
    refactoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)
    capabilities.
  - They also have libraries of common design patterns.
  - Symbol name completions are also useful: type a few characters, and
    it will pop up a list of possible completions. Especially useful if
    you are using large libraries.
