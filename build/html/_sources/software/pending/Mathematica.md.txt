## Installed Versions

As of April 2019, rhel7 installed versions of Mathematica include:

  - '''Mathematica 12.0.0'
  - '''Mathematica 11.3.0'

To use Mathematica, load the appropriate
[module](Quick_Start_Guide:Environment_Modules "wikilink"):

`    $ module load rhel7/mathematica/12.4.1`

Then, to run the command line version:

`    $ math`

To run the GUI version:

`    $ mathematica`

## Fonts

To run the GUI version of Mathematica on the cluster, but displaying to
your own Linux computer, you must have Mathematica fonts installed on
your own computer. (Your computer is providing the display, and needs to
use the local font files.) Please download the fonts from Wolfram:

`    `<http://support.wolfram.com/technotes/fonts/unix/latestfonts.html>

### Font Path Error

  - If an error about font paths occurs, the most likely issue is that
    the Mathematica fonts are not installed or were not installed
    correctly:

<!-- end list -->

  -

        xset:  bad font path element (#90)

## User Environment Setup for Graphical Mathematica

  - When running the graphical instance of Mathematica on the cluster
    head nodes, the X11 protocol is used to display your window on your
    "local system".\[1\]
  - Because Mathematica uses non-standard, customized fonts, you must
    install these fonts manually on your local system.
      - To use them on Linux, follow these instructions (based on
        Wolfram's site\[2\]). **IMPORTANT** These steps ***MUST*** be
        done on your local system and **NOT** on the cluster. This won't
        work if you are following these steps on the cluster head nodes.
  - Font installation instructions:
      - Download the desired fonts
      - Extract them in your home directory
            tar -xzf MathematicaV10FontsLinux.tar.gz -C $HOME
      - On your local machine, add the font path
            xset fp+ $HOME/Fonts/Type1
      - "Rehash" your font path
            xset fp rehash
      - This font path must be established each time you boot your
        system and before you start Mathematica. Users are encouraged to
        set up their desktop environment or personal accounts to add
        these font path steps automatically on system boot or first
        login.

1.  A "local system" is the laptop or workstation that is actually
    displaying the X11 window to you. This local device **must** support
    X11 rendering via an X11 server process. Linux/UNIX graphical
    desktops support this by design. Windows-based local devices require
    supplemental software to support X11. See [Cluster:Using from
