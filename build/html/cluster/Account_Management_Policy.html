<h2>Faculty Account Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#faculty-account-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any faculty member of Wake Forest University’s Reynolda campus may request an
account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account will be
granted to a faculty member pursuing active research or developing innovative
course curriculum requiring the use of resources provided by the WFU DEAC
computing environment. The department chair(s) of the faculty member requesting
the account will receive notification of the account request and approval. The
purpose of this notification is to sustain and grow the facility by raising
awareness of its usage among the chairs and, indirectly, the Dean.</p>
<p>Faculty members from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine campus may
request an account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account
will be granted to a faculty member pursuing active research or developing
innovative course curriculum requiring the use of resources provided and does
not impose strict conditions upon the operation and access to the WFU DEAC
computing environment. As an example, accounts created to conduct research that
requires the entire computing environment to become HIPPA compliant will not be
authorized.</p>
<p>In developing innovative course content, faculty are strongly encouraged to
request the cluster resources required to build the course curriculum.
Educational uses of the cluster are strongly encouraged and given high priority
to ensure the facility and its infrastructure do not impede the goals of the
course.</p>

<h2>Research Faculty Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#research-faculty-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any research faculty member of Wake Forest University may request an account for
use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. If the research faculty member is
operating in the capacity of a post-doctoral research staff member, the account
authorization will derive from the <a class="reference external" href="Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Staff_Account_Requests">Staff Account
Requests</a>
process described below. All other research faculty member account requests will
be evaluated on a case by case basis at the discretion of the WFU DEAC facility
systems management team and the WFU DEAC Representative Committee.</p>

under the following conditions: a) the student’s advisor conducts research
within the WFU DEAC computing environment, b) the student’s advisor endorses the
request for an account.</p>
<p>An account will also be granted to students who are enrolled in a course that
has requested use of the WFU DEAC computing environment as part of an integral
role in the course curriculum. The request for a course related student account
must come from the instructors registered for the course. The course related
accounts shall only be valid for duration of the course. Normal account
termination procedures begin at the end of the semester.</p>

<h2>Authorization Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#authorization-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Requests for account authorization and group membership shall be submitted
through the WFU DEAC facility’s designated request tracking system in production
at the time of the request. This should be done by emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:deac-help&#37;&#52;&#48;wfu&#46;edu">mailto:deac-help<span>&#64;</span>wfu<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> and following the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deac.wfu.edu/accounts.html">User

<div class="section" id="group-membership">
<h2>Group Membership<a class="headerlink" href="#group-membership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each operating system group that is available for assignment to user accounts on
the WFU DEAC facility has a designated approval authority registered for the
group. Each group membership requested for an account shall be approved by that
group’s designated authority prior to its addition. Because of the delays in
communication associated with the designated approval authorities, group
membership requests can take several business days to be approved and assigned
to an account. In the interests of time, authorization and creation of accounts
can be fulfilled <em><strong>without</strong></em> the requested group memberships assigned and, as
the group membership requests are approved, can be added at a later date.</p>
<p>With little or no prior notice to the account holder, any group membership on an
account may be revoked by that group’s designated authority when requested
through the designated request tracking system.</p>
<div class="section" id="sponsorship-and-authorization">
<h3>Sponsorship and Authorization<a class="headerlink" href="#sponsorship-and-authorization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In general, authorized accounts in the WFU DEAC facility are governed and
protected by the “<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html">Policy on Responsible and Ethical Use of Computing
Resources</a>” as approved
by the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/">Wake Forest University Committee on Information
Technology</a>.</p>
<p>However, conditions unique to the WFU DEAC facility exist and must be
emphasized. Specifically, accounts authorized by a sponsor of any kind can be
subject to the status, requests, and decisions of the sponsor. The balance
between the rights of the account holder and the rights of the account sponsor
are difficult to define fairly in a policy. Determination of this balance shall
be under the sole discretion, as an arbiter between the two parties, of the WFU
DEAC facility management and will be guided by the <a class="reference external" href="Cluster:Account_Usage_Policy">Cluster:Account Usage
Policy</a> and “<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html">Policy on Responsible and
Ethical Use of Computing
Resources</a>”.</p>
<p>With little or no prior notice to the account holder, a person that authorizes
or sponsors that account may revoke that authorization at any time and cause the
account to undergo the revocation process.</p>

<div class="section" id="transfer-of-account-authorization">
<h2>Transfer of Account Authorization<a class="headerlink" href="#transfer-of-account-authorization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Users and their accounts are subject to changes in authorization parties (i.e.
‘advisors’) during the course of their academic career at Wake Forest
University. Users are required to notify the WFU DEAC facility management
through the <a class="reference external" href="Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Authorization_Requests">Authorization
Requests</a>
process of any changes that would affect an account’s authorization status or
authority. While not an exhaustive or complete list, such changes include: (a)
change of department, (b) change of degree program, (c) change of research
group, or (d) change of research advisor.</p>
<p>Failure to provide this advance notification could result in the account
