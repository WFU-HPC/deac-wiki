All compute nodes on the DEAC cluster contain INTEL CPUs. Since the DEAC
Cluster adds hardware annually, it is important to know the difference
between chip architecture found on each node. Obviously, newer nodes
house the most recent architectures. Read below to learn more about
INTEL CPUs and their release schedule.

## Process-Architecture-Optimization

  - In March 2016, Intel officially said it could no longer maintain
    it's "tick-tock" model

HERE\] to read an article about the new model.

  - This was first apparent in mid 2015, when Intel said the cycle was
    turning from 2 years into 2.5 years (TICK-TOCK-TOCK)

## Tick-Tock Model

  - Intel processor manufacturing operates on a "tick-tock" model that
    follows Moore's law

::\* **TICK**: when die shrink occurs (ie, 22nm to 14nm)

::\* **TOCK**: new architecture on same die size

## Architectures

A list of Intel's architecture models is as follows

  - 5100 - Woodcrest (65nm Conroe) - 2-core

:\* 5300 - Clovertown (65nm Conroe) - 4-core that were 2x Woodcrest on
same die (no integration)

  - 5400 - Harpertown (45nm Penryn)
  - 5500 - Gainestown (45nm Nehalem)

:\* 5600 - Westmere (32nm Nehalem)

  - E5-2600 - Sandy Bridge (32nm Sandy Bridge) - Supports up to dual
    socket systems

:\* E5-2600v2 - Ivy Bridge (22nm Sandy Bridge)

  - E5-2600v3 - Haswell (22nm Haswell)

:\* E5-2600v4 - Broadwell (14nm Haswell)

  - M3-6Y30 - Skylake (14nm Skylake)

:\* (TBD) - Kabylake (14nm Skylake)

:\* (TBD) - Cannonlake (10nm Skylake)
