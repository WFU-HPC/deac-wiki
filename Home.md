## To-Do

* Some inspiration:
    * https://hpc.uni.lu/
    * https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/
    * https://ulhpc-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Decide directory structure of docs
* Create a template for the software pages, i.e. website, versions, tested, etc.
* Investigate ways to automate doc creation without too much hassle
* Start porting existing wiki
