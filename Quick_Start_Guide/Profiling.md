**Profiling** is a form of dynamic program analysis (as opposed to
static code analysis). It is the investigation of a program's behavior
using information gathered as the program executes. The usual purpose of
this analysis is to determine which sections of a program to optimize -
to increase its overall speed, decrease its memory requirement or
sometimes both.\[1\]

## GCC and gprof

GCC and gprof are GNU tools. Here is a contrived example:\[2\] please
download a copy of the source.

First, you will need to compile with the "-pg" option. Here is an
example Makefile:

`   CC=gcc`
`   CFLAGS=-pg -g`
`   `
`   # Unset the next three because Intel compiler installation`
`   # sets them and they interfere`
`   INCLUDE=`
`   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`
`   CPATH=`
`   `
`   .PHONY: clean`
`   `
`   sieve: sieve.c`
`       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^ -lm`
`   `
`   clean:`
`       /bin/rm -f sieve gmon.out`

Then, run make to build. Run the program as usual: the program will
generate profiling data in a file named **`gmon.out`**. To see the
profiling information, do:

`   `**`[username@headnode`` ``GprofExample]>`**` ./sieve 20000`
`   `*`output`` ``removed`*
`   `**`[username@headnode``
``GprofExample]>`**` gprof sieve gmon.out`
`   Flat profile:`
`   `
`   Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.`
`    no time accumulated`
`   `
`     %   cumulative   self              self     total           `
`    time   seconds   seconds    calls  Ts/call  Ts/call  name    `
`    62.09      0.21     0.21     2263     0.09     0.09  factorial`
`    35.48      0.33     0.12        1   120.63   341.80  sieve`
`     2.96      0.34     0.01     2263     0.00     0.00  foo`
`     0.00      0.34     0.00        1     0.00     0.00  init`
`     0.00      0.34     0.00        1     0.00     0.00  xcalloc`
`     [`*`truncated`*`]`

You will notice that there are two functions which have been called the
most number of times: `factorial`, and `sieve`. Of these two, about 62%
of the total running time was used by the `factorial` function, and 35%
by the `sieve` function.

Read the online gprof manual\[3\] for more information.
