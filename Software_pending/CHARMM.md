## About

From the [official site](http://www.charmm.org/), CHARMM (Chemistry at
HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics):

  - is a versatile and widely used molecular simulation program with
    broad application to many-particle systems
  - has been developed with a primary focus on the study of molecules of
    biological interest, including peptides, proteins, prosthetic
    groups, small molecule ligands, nucleic acids, lipids, and
    carbohydrates, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane
    environments
  - provides a large suite of computational tools that encompass
    numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy
    estimates, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis
    techniques, and model-building capabilities
  - is useful for a much broader class of many-particle systems
  - can be utilized with various energy functions and models, from mixed
    quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom
    classical potentials with explicit solvent and various boundary
    conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models

## Version

Installed versions on the cluster include:

:\* **c35b6**.

## Using CHARMM

Load one of the CHARMM
[modules](Quick_Start_Guide:Environment_Modules "wikilink"):

GNU-compiled:

`module load charmm/c35b6-gnu-serial`

GNU-compiled against Open MPI 1.6

`module load charmm/c35b6-gnu`

Intel compiled

`module load charmm/c35b6-intel-2012-serial`

Intel compiled against Open MPI 1.6

`module load charmm/c35b6-intel-2012`

To run on command line:

`mpirun -np $np charmm`

To take a serial script file:

`mpirun -np $np charmm < filename .`

To run a script file on infiniband:

`mpirun --mca btl ^tcp ${CHARMMDIR}/charmm ...`

## Compilation Instructions

The source contains a script named `install.com` which takes arguments
for building CHARMM. Here is its help message, edited to list only the
host machine types available on DEAC:

**NOTE**: "huge" does not work but "large" does. , most likely would
work if using 8-byte integers. That would involve the "ilp64" version of
the Intel Compiler which the cluster does not
have.

Since the preferred MPI implementation on the cluster is Open MPI 1.6
(implementing MPI-2), and the `install.com` does not have preset options
for it, the `MPISPECIAL` needs to be used.
