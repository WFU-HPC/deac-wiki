## Overview

[GaussView 5](http://www.gaussian.com/g_prod/gv5b.htm) is a molecular
and reaction visualization tool available from the
[Gaussian](http://www.gaussian.com/) corporation.

## Version

Versions on the cluster include:

:\* **5.0.9** For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL6) system image,
we have upgraded the GaussView version to GaussView 5.0.9. The software
is installed along side the Gaussian 09 software underneath the
/deac/opt/gaussian directory on the cluster. Please refer to the
[Software:Gaussian](Software:Gaussian "wikilink") web page for more
information about the location of the specific Gaussian builds in use on
the cluster.

## Usage Restrictions

Access to the software is restricted to faculty, staff, and students of
the Reynolda Campus of Wake Forest University. Users requesting access
to the software **MUST** request that access via the Request Tracker
system by sending email to <deac-help@wfu.edu>.

**NOTE:** You will be required to read and agree to the license terms
for Gaussian found in the
[License:Gaussian](License:Gaussian "wikilink") article.

## Using GaussView 5

Setup is similar to that for [Gaussian
09](Software:Gaussian#Using_Gaussian_09 "wikilink"). Especially, see the
setup for the "CLASS", i.e. CPU class.

Once you have the g09class script installed, make sure you have these
lines in your ~/.cshrc (or ~/.tcshrc) file:

``   setenv g09root /deac/opt/gaussian/`~/bin/g09class` ``
`   source $g09root/g09/bsd/g09.login`

These should set the GV_DIR directory correctly, and sets the alias
"gv" to run GaussView.

## Software Location

  - Generic Link : /deac/opt/gaussian/CLASS/gv
    Version Specific Link : /deac/opt/gaussian09-c.01/CLASS/gv

*(see below for CLASS information)*

## Build Information

The Gaussian 09 software contains optimizations for two classes of Intel
processors that exist in the cluster:

:; EM64T : For Intel processor series 5100, 5300, and 5400.

:; Nehalem : For Intel processor series 5500 and 5600.

By far, the easiest (Gaussian) way to dynamically determine which node
is the following:

  -
    **/deac/opt/gaussian/em64t/g09/bsd/x86type**

There are two possible outputs for our current cluster:

:; intel : indicates *em64t*

:; intel-1 : indicates *nehalem*
