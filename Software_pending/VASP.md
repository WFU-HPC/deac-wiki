# Warning

  - VASP has strict licensing requirements and you must follow the terms
    documented in [License:VASP](License:VASP "wikilink"). These terms
    are the ones you agreed to in order to access the software.

# Environment

We currently "support" the following builds of VASP on the RHEL6
Cluster:

  - vasp/5.2.12/parallel_gamma/intel-2012
  - vasp/5.2.12/parallel_kpoints/intel-2012
  - vasp/5.2.12/serial_kpoints/intel-2012
  - vasp/5.3.3/parallel_gamma/intel-2012
  - vasp/5.3.3/parallel_kpoints/intel-2012
  - vasp/5.3.3/serial_kpoints/intel-2012

As the environment modules suggest, all builds were made with the Intel
2012 compiler suite. There are three VASP build types for each version:

  - parallel_gamma
  - parallel_kpoints
  - serial_kpoints

**PLEASE NOTE:** these builds were handled by a cluster research group
and "support" by the WFU DEAC Cluster is merely restricted to license
control and availability of the software.

## Custom Build Requirements

  - If you need a custom build of VASP, you **MUST** contact the cluster
    team to request a special directory get created.
  - You **CAN NOT** under any circumstance create your own personal
    directory in any arbitrary directory.

:\* You are violating your acceptance of the license terms in doing so.

# Preparing your environment

Example using version 5.3.3, parallel_kpoints type build

  -

    ```
     module load vasp/5.3.3/parallel_kpoints/intel-2012
    ```

At this point, you are ready to use it\!

## Intel Cluster Studio XE 2012 + OpenMPI 1.6

  - Architecture: -xSSE4.1 (All Nehalem nodes support SSE4.1; only some
    Nehalem nodes support SSE4.2)
  - GotoBLAS
      - Edit Makefile.rule
          - TARGET = NEHALEM
          - CC = icc
          - FC = ifort
          - BINARY = 64
  - MKL - use the [Link Line Advisor (MKL
    version 10.3)](http://software.intel.com/sites/products/mkl/):
      - Link with Intel® MKL libraries explicitly
  - **IMPORTANT NOTE ON MEMORY ALLOCATION** -- by default, the Intel
    Fortran compiler will allocate static arrays on the stack. The usual
    trick to set the stacksize limit to "unlimited" in the running shell
    won't work for MPI jobs as the remote jobs are launched by
    mpiexec/mpirun. The trick is to write a C module definining a
    function stacksize_() \[note the underscore at the end of the
    name\], and then calling it in the main VASP program before any work
    is done.\[1\]

## PGI 12.5 + OpenMPI 1.6

  - PGI's compilation notes:
      - GotoBLAS -
        <http://www.pgroup.com/resources/gotoblas/gotoblas_pgi2012.htm>
      - VASP - <http://www.pgroup.com/resources/vasp/vasp_pgi2010.htm>
  - GotoBLAS must use same compilation options as VASP, so must modify
    the default makefile for Nehalem
      - remove "-i8" option everywhere applicable
      - Edit Makefile.rule to change compilation options
          - TARGET = NEHALEM (**NB** "NEHALEM" must be all caps)
          - CC = pgcc
          - FC = pgfortran
          - BINARY = 64
          - NUM_THREADS = 4 (this must be less than the number of
            cores; all Nehalem nodes have 8 cores)
          - COMMON_OPT += -O1 -Kieee (-Kieee forces IEEE-compliant
            division)\[2\]
      - Edit Makefile.system to update the PGI compiler option
        specifying Nehalem architecture:
