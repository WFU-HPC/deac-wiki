## About

  - Cygwin/X is a port of the X Window System to the Cygwin API layer
    for the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Cygwin
    provides a UNIX-like API, thereby minimizing the amount of porting
    required.
  - Because less porting is required, it can more easily handle X11
    forwarding for advanced apps on Windows.

## Installation

  - Cygwin/X is to be installed on your Windows OS.
  - Install Cygwin following the steps listed here:
    **<https://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/setup.html#setup-cygwin-x-installing>**
  - It is vital to select the packages listed on step 15, here are some
    tips:

:\* Select all packages in the X11 category

:\* Select vim under the System category,

:\* Search for SSH and select all matching packages.

  - Once installed, load cygwin from your start menu

## Usage

  - From within the cygwin terminal, run "*startx*"
  - From the new Xterm GUI window that appears...

:\* Click the icon in the lower left corner, and browse the menu to
"System Tools" -\> "Xterm (terminal)"

  - From the Xterm terminal window, type "*ssh -Y pegasus.deac.wfu.edu*"
    to login to the DEAC cluster.
  - Once logged in to the cluster, type "*echo $DISPLAY*" to ensure the
    $DISPLAY variable is set.

:\* If a value is assigned, it is what will ensure software GUIs display
correctly.

:\* If not set, either you forgot the -Y when you SSHed or did not
correctly install all of the X11 packages.

  - Once the xterm window within the Cygwin/X desktop is loaded, you are
    ready to go\!
