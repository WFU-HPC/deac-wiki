## About

**XCrySDen** was written by Anton Kokalj, following a project of Mauro
Causà. The project was initiated because Mauro Causà and Anton Kokalj
felt a growing need for a simple visualization tool aimed at displaying
the crystalline structures. Programming started in 1996 and the first
implementation of the program was made available in 1999.
