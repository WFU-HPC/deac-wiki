An illustration of the structural effects of ATP binding on DNA-bound
MutS structures. The binding of a second ATP to MutS causes
conformational changes, illustrated by color, blue for the largest
conformational changes, green for intermediate changes and red for the
smallest changes. The MutS comples is the prokaryotic equivalent to the
MSH2/MSH6 complex, which are key mismatch repair proteins functioning in
both cell death and repair pathways. Conformational changes in MSH
proteins are critical to the regulation of these
pathways.
