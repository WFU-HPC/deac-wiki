## Overview

This policy governs all aspects of user account management
(authorization, creation, and removal), within the WFU DEAC computing
environment.

## Account Authorization

### Faculty Account Requests

Any faculty member of Wake Forest University's Reynolda campus may
request an account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An
account will be granted to a faculty member pursuing active research or
developing innovative course curriculum requiring the use of resources
provided by the WFU DEAC computing environment. The department chair(s)
of the faculty member requesting the account will receive notification
of the account request and approval. The purpose of this notification is
to sustain and grow the facility by raising awareness of its usage among
the chairs and, indirectly, the Dean.

Faculty members from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine
campus may request an account for use of the WFU DEAC computing
environment. An account will be granted to a faculty member pursuing
active research or developing innovative course curriculum requiring the
use of resources provided and does not impose strict conditions upon the
operation and access to the WFU DEAC computing environment. As an
example, accounts created to conduct research that requires the entire
computing environment to become HIPPA compliant will not be authorized.

In developing innovative course content, faculty are strongly encouraged
to request the cluster resources required to build the course
curriculum. Educational uses of the cluster are strongly encouraged and
given high priority to ensure the facility and its infrastructure do not
impede the goals of the course.

### Research Faculty Requests

Any research faculty member of Wake Forest University may request an
account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. If the research
faculty member is operating in the capacity of a post-doctoral research
staff member, the account authorization will derive from the [Staff
Account
Requests](Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Staff_Account_Requests "wikilink")
process described below. All other research faculty member account
requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis at the discretion of
the WFU DEAC facility systems management team and the WFU DEAC
Representative Committee.

### Staff Account Requests

Any staff member of Wake Forest University may request an account for
use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account will be granted to
a staff member under the following conditions: a) the staff member's
department head or supervisor endorses the request for access, b) the
staff member will be conducting research on behalf of a faculty member
(research associate of any kind) or providing direct support to a
faculty member (Information Technology Group), (c) the staff member is
developing curriculum or instructing a course that requires the use of
the WFU DEAC computing environment.

### Student Account Requests

Any student member of Wake Forest University may request an account for
use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account will be granted to
a student under the following conditions: a) the student's advisor
conducts research within the WFU DEAC computing environment, b) the
student's advisor endorses the request for an account.

An account will also be granted to students who are enrolled in a course
that has requested use of the WFU DEAC computing environment as part of
an integral role in the course curriculum. The request for a course
related student account must come from the instructors registered for
the course. The course related accounts shall only be valid for duration
of the course. Normal account termination procedures begin at the end of
the semester.

### External Person Account Request

An account will be granted to a person who is not directly affiliated
with Wake Forest University provided that: a) the person is directly
collaborating with a faculty member affiliated with Wake Forest
University, b) the WFU faculty member has an existing relationship with
the WFU DEAC computing environment, c) the WFU faculty member endorses
the request for an account. These accounts shall be valid only for the
duration of the collaboration with the WFU faculty member **or** until
the WFU faculty member no longer is affiliated with the WFU DEAC
computing environment.

For clarity, an ***external person*** shall be defined as someone who
has no official, direct relationship (academic or employment) with Wake
Forest University (either the Reynolda Campus or School of Medicine).

In certain cluster administration situations, a short term guest account
may be authorized by the system administration personnel to facilitate
normal operations of the facility.

## Account Termination

### Default Account Authorizations

The default duration for which an account is authorized differs among
the account types delineated above. The following list specifies the
account types and their default period for which they are
authorized:

| Account Type     | Period of Authorization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Faculty          | Duration of faculty member's association with the University, either through employment or emeritus appointment. To ensure faculty accounts are current, renewal requests will be sent every two years to ensure the account is still required.                                               |
| Staff            | As authorized by supervisor up to 2 years, renewable every year thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Staff Class      | For the duration of the course plus one academic semester. Limited extensions can be granted on a case by case basis to allow, as examples, for a student's completion of course requirements or for additional work on the curriculum for publication.                                       |
| Student Research | As authorized by faculty advisor for duration of student's enrollment at the University. Upon request of an advisor, limited extensions can be granted on a case by case basis after a student leaves the University to allow, for example, a student's completion of research collaboration. |
| Student Class    | For the duration of the course. Limited extensions can be granted on a case by case basis to allow, as an example, for the completion of course requirements.                                                                                                                                 |
| External Person  | As authorized by WFU sponsor up to 1 year, renewable every year thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |


Accounts are subject to immediate revocation of their authorization if
use of the account has violated the terms of the [Cluster:Account Usage
Policy](Cluster:Account_Usage_Policy "wikilink") or the "[Policy on
Responsible and Ethical Use of Computing
Resources](http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html)" as
approved by the [Wake Forest University Committee on Information
Technology](http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/).

### Revocation of Account

Once the account is no longer authorized for use on the WFU DEAC
facility, a process shall be used to expire and remove the account. This
automated process will make a best effort to adhere to the following
protocol:

<table style="width:95%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 38%" />
<col style="width: 56%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;"><p>Date relative to end of authorization</p></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><p>Action Taken</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Prior To Authorization Ending</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Account supported and open until authorized or requested extended date arrives.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Day Authorization Ends</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Account is no longer supported and allowed expire.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>After Authorization Ends</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Account remains expired until it is deleted.<br />
Prior to deletion, email is sent to correlating advisor confirming removal and confirming data actions.<br />
If data retention is desired, all file ownership and group membership is changed to correlating advisor.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



The account termination protocol may be abridged or disregarded in cases
where authorization must be terminated abruptly or the adherence to the
protocol would cause significant risk to the normal operation of the WFU
DEAC facilty.

## Account Management

### Authorization Requests

Requests for account authorization and group membership shall be
submitted through the WFU DEAC facility's designated request tracking
system in production at the time of the request. This should be done by
emailing \[[mailto:deac-help@wfu.edu](mailto:deac-help@wfu.edu)|
deac-help@wfu.edu\] and following the
\[<http://www.deac.wfu.edu/accounts.html>| User Account Request\] steps
on the WFU DEAC website.

### Group Membership

Each operating system group that is available for assignment to user
accounts on the WFU DEAC facility has a designated approval authority
registered for the group. Each group membership requested for an account
shall be approved by that group's designated authority prior to its
addition. Because of the delays in communication associated with the
designated approval authorities, group membership requests can take
several business days to be approved and assigned to an account. In the
interests of time, authorization and creation of accounts can be
fulfilled ***without*** the requested group memberships assigned and, as
the group membership requests are approved, can be added at a later
date.

With little or no prior notice to the account holder, any group
membership on an account may be revoked by that group's designated
authority when requested through the designated request tracking system.

#### Sponsorship and Authorization

In general, authorized accounts in the WFU DEAC facility are governed
and protected by the "[Policy on Responsible and Ethical Use of
Computing
Resources](http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html)" as
approved by the [Wake Forest University Committee on Information
Technology](http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/).

However, conditions unique to the WFU DEAC facility exist and must be
emphasized. Specifically, accounts authorized by a sponsor of any kind
can be subject to the status, requests, and decisions of the sponsor.
The balance between the rights of the account holder and the rights of
the account sponsor are difficult to define fairly in a policy.
Determination of this balance shall be under the sole discretion, as an
arbiter between the two parties, of the WFU DEAC facility management and
will be guided by the [Cluster:Account Usage
Policy](Cluster:Account_Usage_Policy "wikilink") and "[Policy on
Responsible and Ethical Use of Computing
Resources](http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html)".

With little or no prior notice to the account holder, a person that
authorizes or sponsors that account may revoke that authorization at any
time and cause the account to undergo the revocation process.

### Transfer of Account Authorization

Users and their accounts are subject to changes in authorization parties
(i.e. 'advisors') during the course of their academic career at Wake
Forest University. Users are required to notify the WFU DEAC facility
management through the [Authorization
Requests](Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Authorization_Requests "wikilink")
process of any changes that would affect an account's authorization
status or authority. While not an exhaustive or complete list, such
changes include: (a) change of department, (b) change of degree program,
(c) change of research group, or (d) change of research advisor.

Failure to provide this advance notification could result in the account
becoming subject to the account removal process.

## Explicit Intent of Policy

Under no circumstances shall the edits or rough drafts or history of
this policy that results from the technology used to create and display
this policy be used to imply any meaning other than that clearly stated
in the written words of the latest version of the policy and approved by
the WFU DEAC facility Representative Committee and management.
