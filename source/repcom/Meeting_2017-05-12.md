# State of the Cluster

  - This part of the agenda will not be covered during the meeting. This
    section is to show the utilization of the cluster in the last 12
    months.

## Cluster Stats

  - **As of May 12, 2017**

>   - Number of Compute-Nodes = **295**
>       - IBM Nodes = 194
>       - UCS Nodes = 94
>       - GPU Nodes = 7

>   - Number of x86 Cores = **4,088**
>   - Number of GPU Cores = **12,032**
>   - Total RAM = **26.5TB**

## Performance Data

  - **Job and Node** numbers last 12 months

> **Average ratios of utilized, idle and repair/testing cluster nodes
> for each month**
>
>   - Avg of Utilized Nodes = 76.03% (+4pts improvement)
>   - Avg of Test/Repair Nodes = 3.96%
>   - Avg of Idle Nodes= 21.04%

  - **Core and Memory** numbers last 12 months

> **Average ratios of utilized, idle and repair/test number of cores for
> each month**
>
>   - Max Utilized Avg = 93.46%
>   - Requested Avg = 70.06%
>   - Utilized Avg = 70.09% (+3pts increase in utilization)

> **Average ratios of utilized and idle of the total memory in cluster
> for each month**
>
>   - Max Utilized Avg = 4.03%
>   - Requested Avg = 26.57%
>   - Utilized Avg = 2.41% (Utilization went down as we increased RAM
>     footprint)
