**R** is open source statistical analysis software.\[1\]

**R** has an IDE called [Software:RStudio](Software:RStudio "wikilink")
that you can use at any head-node

Multi-process **R** with MPI can be found [Software:R - Multiprocess
with MPI](Software:R_-_Multiprocess_with_MPI "wikilink")

## Example

To run on the cluster, you need to run as a batch command. And you will
also need to be aware of file
paths.

`    ###`
`    ### mycomputation.R`
`    ###`
`    # You have a datafile stuff.dat to load in the `
`    # in the same directory where you will issue the `
`    # sbatch command`
`    f <- file.path(Sys.getenv("SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR"), "stuff.dat")`
`    load(f)`
`    `
`    # Do some processing...`
`    # ... and write the output to a file /scratch/${SLURM_JOBID}/my_output.dat`
`    output_file <- file.path("/scratch", Sys.getenv("SLURM_JOBID"), "my_output.dat")`
`   `

and the corresponding SLURM job script, named "my_computation.slurm":

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --partition=small
    #SBATCH --job-name="my_computation"
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL,END
    #SBATCH --output="my_computation-%j.o"
    #SBATCH --error="my_computation-%j.e"
    #SBATCH --mail-user=MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS@wfu.edu
    #SBATCH --account="myresearchGrp"
    #SBATCH --mem=48gb
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
    #SBATCH --time=20:00:00

    module load R/3.5.0

    cd ${SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR}
    scratchdir="/scratch/${SLURM_JOBID}"
    R --vanilla --no-timing CMD BATCH my_computation.R my_computation.out
    mv ${scratchdir}/my_output.dat .

To run, do: **sbatch my_computation.slurm**

## Installing Packages

For R packages to be installed globally on the DEAC cluster please email
deac-help@wfu.edu with name of the desired R package.

If you would like to install an R package locally to your research group
path, you can do so with the following steps:

  - Create a directory where the R packages will be installed
    (Preferably in a shared folder your entire research group can use):

`    mkdir -p /deac/generalGrp/`**`yourResearchGrp`**`/R-packages/`

  - Load the environment module file for your desired version of R and
    start and R session:

`    module load rhel7/R/3.5.0`
`    R`

  - After starting an R session add the directory where you want to
    install the R package to your library
path:

`    R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"`
`    Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing`
`    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)`
`    `
`    R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.`
`    You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.`
`    Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.`
`    `
`    Natural language support but running in an English locale`
`    `
`    R is a collaborative project with many contributors.`
`    Type 'contributors()' for more information and`
`    'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.`
`    `
`    Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or`
`    'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.`
`    Type 'q()' to quit R.`
`    `
`    > .libPaths("/deac/generalGrp/`**`yourResearchGrp`**`/R-packages/")`

  - Now any package you install in this R session will be installed to
    this libPath directory. You are then free to install any package
    using the following command:

`   > install.packages("`*`package_name`*`")`

When submitting jobs to the DEAC cluster you will need to add the
following line to your R script before loading any packages to ensure
your R script is able to find the packages during execution:

`    .libPaths("/deac/generalGrp/`**`yourResearchGrp`**`/R-packages/")`

If you get an error like "X connection to localhost:14.0 broken", that
means that you are not running an X11 display. R's package installation
defaults to using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to select a CRAN
mirror.

To work around this, you can select a CRAN mirror before installing a
package. Doing the following will bring up a terminal-based CRAN mirror
selector:

`    [username@headnode]> chooseCRANmirror(graphics=F)`

and then run the install.packages() command as usual.

If you receive any other errors when trying to install packages this
way, please contact deac-help@wfu.edu for assistance.
