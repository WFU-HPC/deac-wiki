## Compiling

### Compile SAMTOOLS

Find source file at <https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/>

  - Configure

` module load compilers/intel-2017-lp64`

HTSLib has to be built first since Samtools uses it internally.

`./configure CC=icc --prefix=/your/installation/location`
`make all all-htslib`
`make install install-htslib`

Now install samtools

` make`
` make install`

Excusable files are now placed under </your/installation/location/bin>,
you can add this location into your PATH.

### Compile BCFTOOLS

SAMTOOLS requires that BCFTOOLS be installed at the same version number.

Find source file at <https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/releases/>

  - Configure

` module load compilers/intel-2017-lp64`

HTSLib has to be built first since bcftools uses it internally.

`./configure CC=icc --prefix=/your/installation/location`
`make all all-htslib`
`make install install-htslib`

Now install bcftools

` make install`

Excusable files are now placed under </your/installation/location/bin>,
you can add this location into your PATH.
