## Overview

POVray is also known as "Persistence of Vision Raytracer". The home page
for the software is <http://www.povray.org/>. From their website, the
software "is a high-quality, totally free tool for creating stunning
three-dimensional graphics. It is available in official versions for
Windows, Mac OS/Mac OS X and i86 Linux. The source code is available for
those wanting to do their own ports."

A sample of the quality of images that can be generated is found in
their [Hall of Fame](http://hof.povray.org/) gallery.

## Versions

The following versions are available:

  - POVray 3.6.1
  - POVray 3.7.0.rc6

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The beta version appears to default to a
multi-threaded operation. Therefore, when submitting these jobs for
rendering, you must select all the processors on a given node unless you
can configure POVray to use less processing cores.

The software is installed in the usual /deac/opt directory. We have
built the usual environment
[module](Quick_Start_Guide:Environment_Modules "wikilink") files.
