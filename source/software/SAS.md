**SAS 9.3**\[1\] is installed and available on the RHEL6 cluster. Its
use is restricted to staff and students of Wake Forest Baptist Health.
If you require access to SAS, please send a message to
<deac-help@wfu.edu>

## Using

SAS is available only on the RHEL6 cluster. Log in to one of the RHEL6
head nodes for interactive use.

To use SAS, the module must be loaded:

`   $ module load sas-9.3`

This provides the "sas" command. By default, SAS starts in graphical
(GUI) mode. If you are using Windows to access the head nodes, please
see [this article on using Linux graphical displays via
Windows](Cluster:Using_from_Windows "wikilink"). You can also start in
terminal mode, which does not provide a GUI: "sas -nodms"

`    $ sas           `*`to`` ``run`` ``the`` ``graphical``
``interface`*
`    $ sas -nodms    `*`to`` ``run`` ``the`` ``terminal`` ``interface`*
