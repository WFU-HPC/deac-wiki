# Converting SVN repo to GIT

The following is based upon an [online
tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/svn-to-git-prepping-your-team-migration).

## Preparation

  - You will need to use the pre-downloaded svn-migration-scripts.jar
    file on the headnodes

:\* You can also download
[svn-migration-scripts.jar](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/svn-migration-scripts/downloads/svn-migration-scripts.jar)
locally, but additional steps will need to be covered OYO via the
referenced tutorial.

:\* Verify the downloaded file if using locally: *java -jar
~/svn-migration-scripts.jar verify*

  - Generate an "Authors" file to convert SVN commit info to Git format

<!-- end list -->

```
 java -jar svn-migration-scripts.jar authors <svn-repo> > authors.txt
j.doe = j.doe <j.doe@mycompany.com>
m.smith = m.smith <m.smith@mycompany.com><\pre>
:* This will save all users who have committed to the SVN repo, which you will then need to update with full name and email.
* Edit the authors.txt file and change the portion to the right of the "=" to the example below
<pre>
j.doe = John Doe <john.doe@atlassian.com>
m.smith = Mary Smith <mary.smith@atlassian.com>
```

## Converting

  - Beware this process can take a significant amount of time for large
    repos.

:\* For example, a 400MB repository with 33K commits can take around 12
hours.

  - The command to convert a SVN repo with a standard layout
    is:

<!-- end list -->

    git svn clone --stdlayout --authors-file=authors.txt <svn-repo>/<project> <git-repo-name>

  - Where svn-repo is the URI of the SVN repository you are migrating,
    project is the name to be imported, and git-repo-name is the new Git
    repository

<!-- end list -->

```
 git svn clone --stdlayout --authors-file=authors.txt <SVN_URL>/NiceCode NiceCodeAsGit
```

  - Inspect what was migrated

:\* Run *git branch -r* to examine branches moved

:\* Run *git tag* to inspect tags with commits

:\* It's okay if things seem out of order, as long as the content is
there.

  - Next, all tags and branches must be cleaned with the following
    command:

<!-- end list -->

    java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -jar svn-migration-scripts.jar clean-git --force

  - Once fully converted to Git locally, the repository can be imported
    to Bit Bucket via the "I have an existing project" commands given
    after creating a repo.

## Importing

  - Switch to your repository's directory
  - Connect your existing repository to Git

<!-- end list -->

    git remote add origin https://login@<GIT-URL>/repositoryName.git
    git push -u origin master
    <pre>
    * You can now checkout this git repo from Bit Bucket remotely!
    * To test, cd to a different path and clone
    <pre>git clone https://login@<GIT-URL>/repositoryName.git

## SVN to GitHub real world example

  - Create directory for git clone
      - mkdir gitbranch
  - Using a browser, login to www.github.com with login name and
    password
  - Click on "New repository" box
  - Click on "Create repository"
  - On cluster headnode, within git clone directory, run the following
    command:
      - git clone
        <https://>\[<username>@\]github.com/<GIT-REPO>/<REPO>.git
      - Enter password if requested - Note, username only needed for
        PRIVATE repo
  - Enter git branch
      - cd <REPO>
  - Initialize as a git svn repo
      - git svn init --stdlayout --no-metadata <SVN-URL>
  - Modify git config for SVN repo settings
      - git config --edit

<!-- end list -->

```
      1 [core]
      2         repositoryformatversion = 0
      3         filemode = true
      4         bare = false
      5         logallrefupdates = true
      6 [remote "origin"]
      7         fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
      8         url = https://natalieawh@github.com/natalieawh/AtompawProject.g        it
      9 [branch "master"]
     10         remote = origin
     11         merge = refs/heads/master
     12 [svn-remote "svn"]
     13         noMetadata = 1
     14         url = <SVN-URL>
     15         fetch = trunk/<branch to convert>:refs/remotes/trunk/origin
     16         branches = branches/*/<branch to convert>:refs/remotes/origin/*
     17         tags = tags/*/<branch to convert>:refs/remotes/tags/origin/*
```

  -   - NOTE - Git 1.7 does not properly initial svn repo, "origin" must
        be added to "fetch," "branches" and "tags"

Note that the "origin" is critical.

  - After saving this file, then retrieve SVN data
      - git svn fetch
  - After several minutes, there is a stream of file names and the files
    appear in the repository.
  - If multiple branches were retrieved, run bash command:

<!-- end list -->

    /bin/bash
    for branch in `git branch -r |grep "branches/" |sed 's/ branches\///'` ; do
    git branch $branch refs/remotes/branches/$branch
    done
    for tag in `git branch -r |grep "tags/" |sed 's/ tags\///'` ; do
    git tag -a -m"Converting SVN tags" $tag refs/remotes/tags/$tag
    done

  - Push data to git
      - git push --all origin
      - get push --tags origin
