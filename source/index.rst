The WFU DEAC HPC Cluster is a centrally funded resource, meaning it is a free
tool for all Wake Forest University Reynolda Campus researches and students
(excluding the School's of Business, Law, Divinity, and Medicine). The HPC Team
is here to train users, troubleshoot scripts, upgrade hardware and software,
and support user needs.

* This wiki is the starting point reference for all cluster users.
* It is intended to be a community resource for information sharing.
    * Any new entries should aim to make the Cluster user experience easier.
    * We encourage all users (regardless of experience) to check the wiki
      periodically for updates.

* Wiki entries are categorized for convenience, listed below.
    * In general, lower level categories are for newer, less experienced
      cluster users.
    * Higher level categories get into more advanced information and steps.
    * Alphabetized categories are linked to special pages.
