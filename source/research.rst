Structural Comparison of ATP-binding Effects
--------------------------------------------

An illustration of the structural effects of ATP binding on DNA-bound MutS
structures. The binding of a second ATP to MutS causes conformational changes,
illustrated by color, blue for the largest conformational changes, green for
intermediate changes and red for the smallest changes. The MutS comples is the
prokaryotic equivalent to the MSH2/MSH6 complex, which are key mismatch repair
proteins functioning in both cell death and repair pathways. Conformational
changes in MSH proteins are critical to the regulation of these pathways.

This research was conducted on the DEAC cluster by `Professor F. Salsbury
<http://bob.olin.wfu.edu/~web/>`_ of the Physics department who collaborates
with the Scarpinato Lab in the Cancer Biology department.

Fibonacci and Phi
-----------------

One of the first attention getting efforts put for by the cluster was a
collaboration between `Wake Forest University <http://www.wfu.edu>`_ faculty and
performing arts groups. While this page showcases those past collaborations, we
are always open to exploring new, extreme, and unconventional uses of high
performance computing capabilities in works of visual and performing arts as
well as other disciplines in the Humanities.

As part of a collaboration between the `Alban Elved
<http://www.albanelved.com>`_ dance company and the Wake Forest University
`Computer Science <http://www.cs.wfu.edu>`_ Department, "Fibonacci and Phi: Free
Space 2003" combines the realms of art and science into a single performance.
Inspired in part by Wake Forest University's 2003-2004 `Theme year
<http://themeyear.wfu.edu>`_ focus "Fostering Dialog: Civil Discourse in the
Academic Community", the performance challenges the notions of apparent conflict
between the arts and the sciences.

Of direct relevance to the WFU DEAC Osiris cluster, the performance uses real
time generation of fractal images. The dancers trigger particular actions (zoom,
move up, move down, etc.) on the stage through laser beam sensors that are
converted to MIDI signals. These MIDI signals are captured on-stage and
forwarded to the cluster. A MPI-based Mandelbrot program receives the signals,
calculates the fractal image, and ports the X-Windows graphics back to the
on-stage system where it is displayed.

Three nightly performances took place from December 4-6, 2003 and one matinee
performance was held on December 7, 2003. Following each performance, the
members of the production would hold a question and answer session to address
issues related to the production, ranging from technical details to guiding
themes of the event. In addition, two afternoon forums were held in conjunction
with the production to further the dialogue.

In addition to the performances, the scientists (Drs. `Jennifer Burg
<http://www.cs.wfu.edu/~burg/>`_ and `Timothy Miller
<http://www.wfu.edu/~millerte/>`_ involved in the project presented a paper,
"Cluster Computation in Step with Real-Time Dance", to the `International
Society for Computers and Their Applications <http://www.isca-hq.org/>`_ 17th
International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems
(PDCS-2004).
